"As someone who meets a lot of new people every day, I want a quick and easy way to exchange contact information in order to save time and avoid wrong numbers." \
"As someone who struggles to keep track of numbers, emails, and addresses, I want a central app that compiles and organizes my friend's and family's information." \
"As a contractor who wants to advertise my business, I want a way to share my services and contact information digitally so that I can avoid using physical business cards that can be easily lost or damaged."
