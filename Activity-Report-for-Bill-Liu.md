Intractability - Create Scroll Function - To Do \
50 min\
I wrapped the placeholder cards in a function called PageView(). I then changed some of the ratio values to have the card better fit the screen. I added several placeholder cards to the PageView() list for now. A function should be added later that allows the user to add cards on their own. \

**February 13th - February 19th, 2022**

Issues: I spent most of this week figuring out the technicalities of downloading and installing flutter. I successfully set up flutter on my laptop. I pushed the base flutter project template to GitLab. We might switch to flutter as our coding tool instead of swift. Another option is to develop in both swift and flutter simultaneously, but this might not be easy to keep up with. If we want to switch to flutter, I might have to guide you guys through the steps of setting it up in VS Code and installing the emulator since it was quite challenging.
