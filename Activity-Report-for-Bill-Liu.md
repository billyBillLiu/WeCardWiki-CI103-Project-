**February 13th - February 19th, 2022**

Issues: I spent most of this week figuring out the technicalities of downloading and installing flutter. I successfully set up flutter on my laptop. I pushed the base flutter project template to GitLab. We might switch to flutter as our coding tool instead of swift. Another option is to develop in both swift and flutter simultaneously, but this might not be easy to keep up with. If we want to switch to flutter, I might have to guide you guys through the steps of setting it up in VS Code and installing the emulator since it was quite challenging.

I created one placeholder card in the middle of the main page. This will be the general card template for all cards made by the program. The font style and information on the card are currently hardcoded. This will be changed later.
