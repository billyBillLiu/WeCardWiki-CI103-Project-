Re-Formatting the text boxes for editPage - Creating and Saving Cards - ToDo\
45 minutes\
I modify the text boxes on the editPage to where it will fit in the screen properly. I also made it to where when you type in the text box the word that was original on the text box will disappear on the screen. I also created spaces in between the text boxes to make it more visually appealing. Everything we put in to the text box will be able to properly display on the edit card and stay on it even if we scroll the pages.

Re-Formatting the placeholder cards - Creating and Saving Cards - ToDo\
I modify the home page card so it looks more professional. Instead of going horizontally I made it a vertical card. I have the name on the very top, the profile picture in the middle and the other infos on the bottom.

Create a QR code generator - QR code - ToDo\
30 minutes\
I went through two videos of how different people use different ways to generate QR codes using flutter. I realize that many of them used a text box where they ask for an input to create their QR codes. That will not be something that we want to do with our app.

Using objects to generate QR codes - QR code - ToDo\
30 minutes\
I realize that using objects to generate QR codes is how it should be done for our app. Each device is its own object which means that each device has a different object and we could use that to generate their own unique QR codes. This is the foundation or a rough idea of how QR codes will be generated. \
