QR code generator - Sharing Cards - ToDo \
2 hour \

I was able to build a QR code generator that generates QR codes based on what the user inputted. Even though it might not be what we ultimately wanted, but it is still a QR code generator. What I need to do afterwards is trying to figure out what I can do with this QR code generator so that it produces based on the user's username and other infos they user enters.

Place the generated QR code into the QR code page - Sharing Cards - ToDO \
10 mins \

I haven't really touch upon it yet so it is still in process. I though about ways to approach it but haven't really done much. I plan on having editing the page how other pages are where we the QR code will be in the middle with a title on top and maybe have a few words on the bottom.

QR code generator - Sharing Cards - ToDo \
1 hour \

I watch first went online to search for how QR code generators work. I found multiple QR code generators where they first ask for the kind of category you using it in. They will ask you for the necessary informations that's needed for this category. I learn how they generate QR codes. Then I move on to different videos on how people did their QR code generators. They all seem to be generators that generate based on what the user type in the text box. The QR code generator that I wanna make is one that generators based on the user's username. That will be something That I need to figure out. \

In order to do this I have to first complete the QR code generator, but since I don't have it complete the only thing i could do for this task is look up ways to better format that QR code page to where it is more visually appealing to the user. \

Issues: I realize that the way we lay out the card might not be the most efficient for people to exchange their cards. The doesn't look professional enough so I decided to modify the way it looks.

Re-Formatting the text boxes for editPage - Creating and Saving Cards - ToDo\
45 minutes\
I modify the text boxes on the editPage to where it will fit in the screen properly. I also made it to where when you type in the text box the word that was original on the text box will disappear on the screen. I also created spaces in between the text boxes to make it more visually appealing. Everything we put in to the text box will be able to properly display on the edit card and stay on it even if we scroll the pages.

Re-Formatting the placeholder cards - Creating and Saving Cards - ToDo\
I modify the home page card so it looks more professional. Instead of going horizontally I made it a vertical card. I have the name on the very top, the profile picture in the middle and the other infos on the bottom.

Create a QR code generator - QR code - ToDo\
30 minutes\
I went through two videos of how different people use different ways to generate QR codes using flutter. I realize that many of them used a text box where they ask for an input to create their QR codes. That will not be something that we want to do with our app.

Using objects to generate QR codes - QR code - ToDo\
30 minutes\
I realize that using objects to generate QR codes is how it should be done for our app. Each device is its own object which means that each device has a different object and we could use that to generate their own unique QR codes. This is the foundation or a rough idea of how QR codes will be generated. \
