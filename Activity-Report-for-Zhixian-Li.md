April 10th - April 17th, 2023

Issues: Having trouble implementing ways to save user data on editPage. Tried various approach such as utilizing objects and file reading and writing but can not work out a solution after spending more than 5 hours due to my own flutter being outdated and can not figure out a way to update to the latest version. Request assistance for implementation.

Added a card object which draws and pushes its information onto the current editPage variables by using getters. Currently does not work as intended, and will need further inspection and analysis on the code. \

February 13th - February 20th, 2023

Issues: Due to the difficulty of getting SwiftUI running for all team members including me. As a team, we should be discussing an alternative base for our code to start. Currently we are looking at Flutter and hope that it will be a much easier location to work together. Since we are switching language, all of our previous work needs to be reviewed and changed to the language we are going to use.

Sketch a UI design - comment - Review \

I commented that we should also consider completion of the user story tasks before moving to review. Though we have a clear design, we are currently lacking the founding base for our project. We should get this started as soon as possible when our team gets Swift installed. \
