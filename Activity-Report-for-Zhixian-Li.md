February 13th - February 20th, 2023

Issues: Due to the difficulty of getting SwiftUI running for all team members including me. As a team, we should be discussing an alternative base for our code to start. Currently we are looking at Flutter and hope that it will be a much easier location to work together. Since we are switching language, all of our previous work needs to be reviewed and changed to the language we are going to use.

Sketch a UI design - comment - Review \
15 minutes \
I commented that we should also consider completion of the user story tasks before moving to review. Though we have a clear design, we are currently lacking the founding base for our project. We should get this started as soon as possible when our team gets Swift installed. \
