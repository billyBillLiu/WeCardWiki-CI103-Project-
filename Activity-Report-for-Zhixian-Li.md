April 30th - May 6th, 2023

Issues: I have watched several tutorial videos on implementing a way to edit the cards directly on tapping on the area associated with the type of information, but none of them have helped me as much. I am currently having slight progress but may need Bill's or Jia's assistance.

Creating and Saving Cards - Create getter and setter methods for images in card class - moved to In Progress \
30 minutes \
From the task "Create method that prompts for a picture," this is a task that derived from it. In the blankCard.dart, I added new attribute profileImage which stores a string of a link from the asset folder. I created a setter method that allows for changing the string of the attribute. \

Creating and Saving Cards - Editing card information directly on the card - moved to In Progress \
90 minutes \
I changed the first displayed text box in the blankCard.dart into a GestureDetector, which allows a form on input to be registered and perform a certain action. I currently have the action set to a print, which validates that the input is working properly. Might take the approach of using an AlertDialog for the moment being as that is what I can see being accomplished for the knowledge that I have. \

Creating and Saving Cards - Create Scrollable View for editPage - moved to Review \
45 minutes \
Modified the editPage file where instead of displaying each widgets as items in a column, each item is now framed inside of a ListView that allows the user to scroll up and down on the entire page. Test works for extending the page by filling up the spaces of editPage that overruns to the bottom. \

Creating and Saving Cards - Create method that prompts for a picture - moved to In Progress \
30 minutes \
Changed the placeholder image where it originally displayed a filled in box to an actual image, and created an assets folder with an image that will represent the new placeholder image for the blankCard. This change of code is a required step into being able to modify the placeholder image into a user-selected image. Further implementation requires modifying editPage and creating new setters and getters for blankCard class. \

April 18th - April 23rd, 2023

Issues: After analyzing the code, a potential reason for the data not being able to be saved could be caused by input validation, though there is no clear indication. After working on a branch that did not have the input validation I was able to save the data onto the editpage page. I have tried to push out a merge request without the input validation part of the code, but the current main branch does not accept automatically. Would require manual reviews to merge the code.

15 minutes \
Following the format that Jiahao has made changes to in the placeholder card, I reformatted the card in the editpage to have similar elements with those cards. Tested that all form of data typed on the text boxes will appear and format properly in accordance with the placeholder card formats. \

April 10th - April 17th, 2023

Issues: Having trouble implementing ways to save user data on editPage. Tried various approach such as utilizing objects and file reading and writing but can not work out a solution after spending more than 5 hours due to my own flutter being outdated and can not figure out a way to update to the latest version. Request assistance for implementation.

Added a card object which draws and pushes its information onto the current editPage variables by using getters. Currently does not work as intended, and will need further inspection and analysis on the code. \

February 13th - February 20th, 2023

Issues: Due to the difficulty of getting SwiftUI running for all team members including me. As a team, we should be discussing an alternative base for our code to start. Currently we are looking at Flutter and hope that it will be a much easier location to work together. Since we are switching language, all of our previous work needs to be reviewed and changed to the language we are going to use.
